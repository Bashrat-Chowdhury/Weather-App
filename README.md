# <Weather App>

## Description

This challenge was to create a weather app that lets user search for any city and displays the current weather conditions (temperature, wind speed and humidity) for the searched location. Furthermore, it also displays the 5 day weather forecast for the searched location under the current weather conditions. The user can see their past searches and link on any past-searhced city and the page will update to display the selected city's current and future weather conditions.

This project was a combtion of HTML, CSS, and javascript. 2 server-side APIs were used for this project : a 5 day weather forecast API and a Geocoding API.
